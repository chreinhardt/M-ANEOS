# ANEOS
ANEOS source code and input files

This is currently a duplicate of the version of ANEOS distributed as part of the iSALE shock physics code.

To compile run `make` in the `src` directory. This creates library `libaneos.a` and executable `aneos`.

The latter expects to find a valid ANEOS input file, with the name `ANEOS.INPUT`, in the same directory as the program.

Available input files can be found in the `input` directory.
